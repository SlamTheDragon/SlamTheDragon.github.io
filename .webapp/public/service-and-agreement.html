                        <h2>User-Commissioner Agreement</h2>
                        <p>Before contacting me, please provide your character's reference sheet including the order of your choice. Once received we'll be discussing some small matters regarding your commission request. After that, I'll be sending my PayPal
                            account once we got a deal according to your order. To keep everything neat and secure, Slam will only accept your request if you agree upon the following:
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Prices Under $75</h3>
                    <p>Slam requires full payment of your selected offer of the final pricing we had discussed (<a href="#Pricing">See Pricing</a>). Once the payment is received, Slam will proceed and start doing your commission request at his available
                        schedule slots.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Prices Above $75</h3>
                    <p>Larger and costly commissions are a bit daunting to get fully paid in the first place. Slam can offer a 40% downpayment of the final discussed price of the available offer of your choice. Once the initial payment is received, Slam
                        will proceed and start doing your commission request at his available schedule slots. And finally, Slam will inform you once the piece has been finalized and will wait for the remaining payment before releasing the output to you.</p>

                    <p>The length or duration of each piece can neither take up to 1-3 days or 2 weeks or even more depending on what offer you took as well as my schedule and availability.</p>

                    <h2 id="Pricing">Pricing</h2>
                    <p>Prices are based per <strong>character/OC</strong> of yours. <span id="example">(e.g. If you want to commission for two characters in one illustration, the total price of the original offer will be doubled).</span> This will be the
                        main factor in pricing your commissioned piece. Another one is complexity. The more complex your character the higher the price will be. Lastly, time. If you're in a hurry or wanted to get your commissioned piece done sooner I
                        have to charge you so that I have a reason to consider your commission request as my top priority. In addition, I can take up to
                        <strong>1 iteration only</strong> of the finalized take of the piece but I have to <strong>charge</strong> you an additional $20, more or less depending on how big the scope of iteration is.</p>
                    <p>To sum everything up, The prices posted on my <a href="/commissions.html">Commissions</a> page might be higher depending on any extras we end up adding during the process. These factors may or may not affect the final price of your
                        placed order from me. Additionally, my rates may change depending on my life status and demand.</p>
                </section>

                    <h1>Extras</h1>
                    <p>You can freely tap me in my DMs regarding the progress of the commission you had on me. If you have any questions or clarifications hit me up in <a href="https://discord.com/users/345819451247296516" target="_blank">Discord</a>, my
                        DMs are always open!</p>
                    <p>If you are looking forward to getting me involved in such works on some custom/special arranged commissions OR any big related things (such as animation, storyboarding, or any possible studio-related work concerning concept art and
                        illustration) I'm not yet open to that, unfortunately. I'll keep you updated via <a href="https://twitter.com/SlamTheDragon" target="_blank">Twitter</a> whenever I have updated this section/changed my mind.</p>
